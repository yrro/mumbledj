Debian packing of mumbledj
==========================

To build the package, first run `dpkg-checkbuilddeps` to ensure that
dependencies are availble; then run `dpkg-buildpackage -b`, which will spit out
`mumbledj_${version}_${arch}.deb` in the parent directory.

After installing the deb, see the README.Debian file for information about
configuring mumbledj's launch arguments, API keys, etc.
